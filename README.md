## Usage

Everything should be pretty straight forward. However, there are a couple of things to note:

* `Mod Class Name` and `Skin Class Name` should not contain any spaces.
* When adding or changing skins, you can select a color in the palette to change it from within the application.
* When importing a skin, please make sure the palette colors are set correctly. Only changing the colors on Hat Kid will not work.
* Compiling and cooking applies to all mods. This means there might be warnings or errors caused by external factors.
  * If this is the case, I recommend moving out your other mods out of the Mods folder before compiling and cooking.
